    {"role": "assistant", "content": " Hello! I'd be happy to help assess your knee osteoarthritis severity. Before looking at any imaging, I'd like to gather some information about your symptoms and medical history to better understand your condition."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Could you share some basic information about yourself such as your age and gender?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": " I'm 59 years old, male."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you. And what about your height and weight?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I weigh 78.1 kg and I'm about 181 cm tall."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That gives you a BMI of 23.8, which falls within the normal healthy range. What type of work do you do?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm a delivery driver—I'm on my feet most of the day."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's helpful context. Your occupation involves significant standing and likely repetitive movements, which could impact your knee symptoms. In your own words, what bothers you most about your knee symptoms?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Mostly the right knee. I experience aching pain after walking, stairs are particularly difficult, and sometimes it locks or catches when I move."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's quantify your symptoms using the KOOS questionnaire to better understand the impact. I'll ask about specific activities and symptoms for each knee separately. For your right knee, how would you rate your pain during walking on flat ground?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Mild"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Going up or down stairs?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Moderate."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "At night while in bed?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Mild."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sitting or lying down?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "None."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Standing upright?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Mild."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now for your left knee, same questions. Walking on flat ground?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "None."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Any other pain symptoms with the left knee?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "No pain at rest."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regarding other symptoms in your right knee, how would you describe morning stiffness?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Mild."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Any grinding, clicking or catching sensations?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Moderate."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Have you experienced swelling this past week?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Mild."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": " And for your left knee, any of these symptoms?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "No symptoms. The left knee feels completely fine."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now for activities that might be challenging. How difficult is it to kneel, squat, jump, or pivot?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I avoid all of those—they're too painful."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How often are you aware of your knee problem?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Most of the time."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does it limit your confidence in movement?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes—severely."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Overall, how much does it impact your daily life?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Quite a lot."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on your responses, here are your calculated KOOS scores:\nRight Knee Pain: 77.8/100\nRight Knee Symptoms: 67.9/100\nLeft Knee Pain & Symptoms: 100/100\nSport/Recreation Function: 40/100\nQuality of Life: 25/100\nThese scores align with your reported symptoms and confirm the significant impact on your quality of life and functional activities. Let's evaluate your muscle strength and range of motion. Can you straighten your right knee while sitting?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, but it feels weaker than the left."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try pushing your leg against resistance. Do you notice any giving way?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": " I can push, but definitely not as strong as I'd expect."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That suggests your right quadriceps strength is approximately 4 out of 5 (good, but not normal). For your hamstrings, can you pull your heel back smoothly when seated?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": " And when resisting that movement?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": " It's a bit weaker, but manageable."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your hamstring strength also appears to be around 4/5. Can you fully bend and straighten your right knee?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": " Flexion seems okay, but I'm missing a few degrees on full extension."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Would you say that's approximately 105° flexion with about 6° extension lag?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, that's about right."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do you have any previous injuries to either knee?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I twisted my right knee playing soccer about 15 years ago. Had some swelling but never got it properly checked."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": " Any surgeries on either knee?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": " No surgeries."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago. It's controlled with medication."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "What medications are you currently taking?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure, and I take over-the-counter ibuprofen for my knee pain as needed."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How often do you take the ibuprofen, and at what dosage?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Usually 400mg, maybe 3-4 times a week when the pain gets bad."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Any allergies to medications?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "None that I know of."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": " Is there any history of arthritis in your family?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "My father had knee problems in his 60s, and my mother has rheumatoid arthritis."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "What treatments have you tried so far for your knee pain?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Just the ibuprofen and some ice when it swells. I bought a knee brace from the pharmacy, but it didn't help much."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": " Have you had any physical therapy or rehabilitation?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "No, this is my first time seeking professional help for it."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "What are your goals for treatment?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I want to reduce the pain so I can keep working. I'd like to be able to walk without discomfort and maybe get back to some light hiking, which I used to enjoy."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do you have any preferences for treatment approaches? For example, are you open to injections, physical therapy, or would you prefer to start with more conservative options?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'd prefer to avoid surgery if possible. I'm open to most other options, but would rather start conservatively."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for the details.  Once the conversation ends, please upload standing X-rays of both knees using the button below this chat for further analysis."}
