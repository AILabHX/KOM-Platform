Range of motion is limited with an inability to fully straighten the knee (flexion contracture beyond 10 degrees) and/or bend it adequately (flexion less than 90 degrees). Functional joint stability is intact, symptoms primarily affect one compartment, with mild to moderate severity observed. Imaging shows joint space narrowing but normal alignment overall. Additional mechanical symptoms are present, and the patient is relatively young.
